            <strong class="wfgenerator">WfGen</strong> targets the generation of <strong>realistic</strong>
            synthetic workflow traces with a variety of characteristics. The workflow generator, provided as part of the
            <strong><a href="https://docs.wfcommons.org" target="_blank">WfCommons Python package</a></strong>, uses
            recipes of workflows for creating different synthetic workflows based on distributions of
            workflow job runtime, and input and output file sizes. The resulting workflows are represented in the
            <a href="/format" class="wfformat">WfFormat</a>, which is already supported by simulation
            frameworks such as <a href="https://wrench-project.org" target="_blank">WRENCH</a>.

            The WfCommons Python package provides a number of workflow recipes for generating realistic synthetic
            workflow traces. Each recipe provides different methods for generating synthetic, yet realistic, workflow
            traces depending on the properties that define the structure of the actual workflow.
