            Workload traces are widely used to profile and characterize workflow executions, and to build distributions
            of workflow execution behaviors, which are used to evaluate methods and techniques in simulation or in real
            conditions.

            <strong style="color: #48B54E">WfTraces</strong> provides the collection and curation of open access
            production workflow executions from various scientific applications shared in a common trace format. The
            <strong><a href="https://docs.wfcommons.org" target="_blank">WfCommons Python package</a></strong> provides
            a set of tools for analyzing traces, which can be used to develop workflow recipes for the

            In this page, we keep a list of open access workflow execution trace repositories that host traces compliant
            with The <strong><a href="/json-format">WfCommons JSON format</a></strong> for describing workflow
            executions. We are constantly seeking for additional workflow execution traces for refining or developing
            new workflow recipes for the WfCommonsâ€™s <a href="/generator" style="color: #EF762F">WfGenerator</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Workflow execution traces are organized into sub-folders within the repositories. Each sub-folder represents
            a workflow application, which itself contains sub-folders for workflow executions in different computing
            platforms. For each workflow application, a <code>README.md</code> file provides detailed description of the workflow
            structure and pointers to relevant material.
